            <h2>Forza Horizon 3</h2><br>
            <h3>Overview</h3><br>
            <p>Forza Horizon 3 is an open world racing video game developed by Playground Games and published by Microsoft Studios for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. The game features cross-platform play between the two platforms. The game was released on 23 September 2016 for Ultimate Edition players, and 27 September 2016 for standard and Deluxe Edition players. It is the third Forza Horizon and the ninth instalment in the Forza series. As with previous Horizon games, Turn 10 Studios assisted Playground Games in the game's development. It is set in a fictional representation of Australia. Additional content has been released in the form of car packs and two world expansions, which also include additional cars.</p><br>
               
            <p>The game received universal acclaim from critics upon release. On review aggregator site Metacritic, the Xbox One version holds an average critic score of 91/100, based on 91 reviews, making it the most-acclaimed Forza Horizon title to date. The Windows version holds a score of 86/100, based on 12 critics.</p><br><br>
            <h3> Description</h3><br>
            <p>Forza Horizon 3 is a racing video game set in an open world environment based in a fictional representation of Australia. The gameplay world is expansive, twice the size of its predecessor in the series Forza Horizon 2, and includes locales such as Surfers Paradise, Byron Bay, Yarra Valley, Woods Point, Coober Pedy and the Outback. Players compete in various events around the game's world, including various forms of races, time trials, drifting, and Bucket List Challenges. During Bucket List Challenges, the player is given a specific car and task. For example, the player may need to reach a certain top speed in the Ford GT before time runs out. Players can also find billboards throughout the gameplay world, which, when driven over, award the player with experience points or discount on fast travelling. Upgrades and vehicles can be purchased through any of the game's festival sites. Here the player can also choose to expand a site with additional events as they progress. A total of 350 cars are available to players at launch.</p><br>

            <p>While previous Horizon games have depicted the player as one of the racers of the Horizon Festival, the player is now the director of the Festival, and their role is to make it the biggest festival in the world. As director, the player can hire or fire other drivers as part of their racing team as well as organise and customise races and Bucket List events around the map using the new Horizon Blueprint feature. The player can customise the character's style and ethnicity, as well as being able to customise the vehicles with custom paints and designs, upgrades and body kits from more popular manufacturers like Rocket Bunny and Liberty Walk. As players progress throughout the game they will receive notifications informing the player of barn find rumours. When found, the player's mechanic will restore the barn find for the player to use. Players can also design liveries for vehicles. These liveries can be sold through the game's transactional system, which also includes an auction system to purchase cars from other players. Forza Horizon 3 makes use of Turn 10 Studios Drivatar technology from previous Xbox One Forza games. The game features a four player co-operative multiplayer campaign and cross-platform play, as it is a part of the Xbox Play Anywhere program.</p><br><br>
